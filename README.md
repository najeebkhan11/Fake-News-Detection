Project Description – Fake News Detection using NLP \& Machine Learning

Fake news has become a major challenge in today’s digital world, leading to misinformation and misleading public opinion. This project focuses on building an intelligent Fake News Detection System using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automatically classify news articles as Fake or Real.

The system is trained on a real-world news dataset, where textual data is preprocessed using NLP techniques such as text cleaning, tokenization, and stop-word removal. Feature extraction is performed using TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization, which converts textual information into meaningful numerical representations suitable for machine learning models.

A supervised machine learning model is trained using Scikit-learn, achieving reliable performance in distinguishing fake news from genuine news articles. The trained model and vectorizer are saved and reused for efficient predictions without retraining.

To make the system user-friendly and accessible, the model is deployed as a web application using Streamlit. The application allows users to enter any news text and instantly receive a prediction indicating whether the news is fake or real. This demonstrates a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow, from data preprocessing and model training to deployment and real-time inference.

This project showcases practical skills in Python programming, Machine Learning, NLP, model serialization, and web deployment, making it suitable for real-world applications and an excellent demonstration of applied data science and software development concepts.
